To progress, click the forward icon. To replay a module, click the replay icon. If you want to review a certain section, use the back icon.</p><br><p><b>Learning Objectives</b></p><p><strong>At the end of this course, you will be able to :</strong></p><p><ul> <li>Identify the importance of vaccination</li> <li>Identify safe vaccine storage and handling practices</li> <li>Prioritize appropriate and timely documentation of vaccination&nbsp;</li> <li>Identify that vaccination providers have a responsibility to provide employees with information about vaccination&nbsp;</li> <li>Identify the vaccine information to include in the medical record</li> </ul></p><br><p><b>Importance of Vaccination</b></p><p>Vaccination is important because it protects against various potentially life-threatening diseases. It is estimated that vaccines are responsible for preventing the death of up to 3 million people in the U.S. every year.&nbsp;</p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine vaccination to prevent 17 vaccine-preventable diseases that occur in infants, children and adults.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since vaccines were introduced, disease rates have significantly declined. Diseases including smallpox, polio and tetanus that used to disable or kill millions of people no longer pose a serious threat.</p> <p>Vaccination continues to be a pivotal practice for population health management and individual safety and well-being.</p><br><p><b>Immunization Best Practices</b></p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is a group of public health and medical experts who provide recommendations on vaccine usage and administration to control diseases in the United States.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick glance at some concerns faced by vaccine providers:</p> <ul> <li>Timing of each dose</li> <li>Screening for contraindications and precautions</li> <li>Number of vaccines to be administered</li> <li>Educational needs of each patient</li> <li>Interpreting and responding to adverse events</li> </ul> <p>Vaccination providers have a responsibility to provide employees with vital information about vaccination.</p> <p>ACIP&rsquo;s <em>General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization</em> address concerns that commonly arise when providing vaccinations. The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other healthcare providers who deal with vaccines on a regular basis.</p> <p>As part of best practices, we will review the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Timing and Spacing of Immunobiologics</li> <li>Contraindications and Precautions</li> <li>Preventing and Managing Adverse Reactions</li> <li>Environment for Vaccine Administration</li> <li>Storage and Handling of Immunobiologics</li> <li>Altered Immunocompetence</li> <li>Vaccination Records</li> <li>Vaccination Programs</li> </ul></p><br><p><b>Timing and Spacing of Immunobiologics</b></p><p>The way an employee responds to a vaccine depends on multiple factors. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Type of vaccine</li> <li>Age of the recipient</li> <li>Immune status of the recipient</li> </ul> <p>In most scenarios, vaccines are recommended for members of the youngest age group at risk of experiencing the disease for which vaccine efficacy and safety have been demonstrated.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Immunization Schedules for Persons Aged 0 Through 18 Years&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule is revised annually. Physicians and other healthcare providers should ensure that they are following current schedules.</p> <ul> <li>Recommendations for vaccines must be based on age (<a href='https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#birth-15' target='_blank'>Table 1</a>)</li> <li>Appropriate intervals must be followed for catch-up, as needed (<a href='https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/catchup.html' target='_blank'>Table 2</a>)</li> <li>Vaccine recipients must be assessed for medical indications (<a href='https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html' target='_blank'>Table 3</a>)</li> </ul> <p>In occupational health we only immunize adults. Any request for immunizations of infants or children must be approved by WorkCare&rsquo;s Vice President of Clinic Operations or Chief Medical Officer.</p>"}

					"info" : {"Transcript" : "<p><b>Contraindications and Precautions</b></p><p><strong>Contraindications</strong> are conditions that increases the risk for an adverse reaction in a recipient.</p> <p>The only contraindication that applies to all vaccines is a history of allergic reaction after a prior dose of vaccine or to a vaccine constituent.</p> <p><strong>Precautions </strong>are not contraindications, but are conditions to be considered in determining if the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.&nbsp;</p> <p>Vaccines should not be administered when contraindications and precautions are present. It is important to note that a majority of contraindications and precautions are temporary - this means that vaccinations can be administered later when the condition leading to a contraindication or precaution no longer exists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Healthcare professionals who administer vaccines should screen employees for contraindications and precautions prior to each dose of a vaccination. Screening can be facilitated through questionnaires.</p> <p>Here is a list of people who should not be administered live vaccines due to their specific health conditions:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Severely immunocompromised persons&nbsp;</li> <li>Pregnant women&nbsp;</li> <li>Employees who experienced encephalopathy within 7 days after administration of a previous dose of pertussis-containing vaccine not attributable to another identifiable cause. They should not receive additional doses of a vaccine that contains pertussis&nbsp;</li> <li>Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disease and a history of intussusception are both contraindications to the receipt of rotavirus vaccines</li> </ul></p><br><p><b>Preventing and Managing Adverse Reactions</b></p><p>Before administering the vaccines, the employee should be informed about benefits and risks.&nbsp;</p> <p>The information should match the recipient&rsquo;s ability to comprehend it and in a langauge they understand. The employee&nbsp; should be given the opportunity to ask questions before each vaccination. The employee&nbsp; must receive a written copy of the most recent Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).</p> <p>Vaccines are intended to produce active immunity to specific antigens. An adverse reaction is an undesirable side effect that occurs after a vaccination. Adverse reactions can be classified as follows:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Local</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;These are usually the least severe and most frequent. For example, redness on the skin.</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Systemic</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;They occur less frequently than local reactions. For example, fever.</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Allergic&nbsp;</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;They are the least frequent reactions. For example, anaphylaxis.</p> <p>Syncope is a condition that complicates systemic reactions. It is a vasovagal or vasodepressor reaction that occurs after vaccination. It most commonly occurs among adolescents and young adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2005, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) noticed&nbsp; a trend of increasing syncope in three respective vaccines. These vaccines included:</p> <ul> <li>Human papillomavirus (HPV)</li> <li>MenACWY</li> <li>Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis)</li> </ul> <p>Among 463 VAERS reports of syncope during January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2007, 41 listed syncope with secondary injury with information on the timing after vaccination. The majority of these syncope reports (76%) occurred among adolescents. Among all age groups, 80% of reported syncope episodes occurred within 15 minutes of vaccine administration.&nbsp;</p> <p>Providers should take appropriate measures while administering vaccines. This includes careful observation, including whether the employeebecomes weak, dizzy or loses consciousness. The following steps need to be taken to prevent injuries:</p> <ul> <li>Employee&nbsp; should be seated or lying down during vaccination</li> <li>Vaccine providers should consider observing employees&nbsp; for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they faint</li> <li>If syncope develops, employees should be observed until the symptoms resolve</li> <li>Emergecy response and reporting procedures for your location should be followed for any syncope incidents.</li> </ul></p><br><p><b>Environment for Vaccine Administration</b></p><p>Vaccines should be administered in a clean and designated area where no potentially contaminated items are placed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Multi-dose vials to be used for more than one employee should not be kept in the immediate employee treatment area. This helps prevent inadvertent contamination of the vial through direct or indirect contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment that could cause infections in subsequent employees.</p> <p>&nbsp;Different, single components of combination vaccines should never be mixed in the same syringe unless specifically licensed for such use. Single-dose vials and manufacturer-filled syringes are designed for single-dose administration and should be discarded if vaccine has been withdrawn or reconstituted and subsequently not used within the timeframe specified by the manufacturer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Syringes that are prefilled by the manufacturer and activated, but unused should be discarded at the end of the day. For inactivated vaccines,&nbsp; manufacturers typically recommend use within the same day that a vaccine is withdrawn.&nbsp;</p> <p>For live vaccines that require reconstitution, manufacturers typically recommend the vaccine be used immediately after reconstitution. Manufacturers recommend discarding them if not used within 30 minutes after reconstitution. For example, varicella vaccine should be discarded if not used within 30 minutes after reconstitution. MMR vaccine, once reconstituted, must be kept in a dark place at 36&deg;F to 46&deg;F and should be discarded within 8 hours if not used.</p> <p>When in doubt about the appropriate handling of a vaccine, vaccination providers should contact that vaccine&rsquo;s manufacturer.</p>"}

The assigned expiration date refers to the date after which an opened multi-dose vial should not be used. The assigned expiration date should never exceed the manufacturer&rsquo;s original expiration date.</p> <p>&nbsp;For example, if a vial was opened on the date of 11-1-2019, it would have an assigned expiration date that is 28 days later on 11-29-2019.</p> <p>If the manufacturer&rsquo;s expiration date is 11-20-2019 and the vial is opened on 11-1-2019, the assigned expiration date would match the manufacturer&rsquo;s expiration date of 11-20-2019.</p><br><p><b>Altered Immunocompetence</b></p><p>Identification of altered immunocompetence is important to the vaccine provider because incidence or severity of some vaccine-preventable diseases is higher in persons with altered immunocompetence. Certain vaccines, such as inactivated influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccines, are recommended specifically for persons with these diseases.&nbsp;</p> <p>You may have to defer administration of live vaccines until the employee&rsquo;s immune function has improved. Remember that persons with altered immunocompetence who receive live vaccines might be at an increased risk for an adverse reaction. This is due to uninhibited growth of the attenuated live virus or bacteria. Vaccines might be less effective during the period of altered immunocompetence.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is ideal to defer inactivated vaccines during a period of altered immunocompetence. This is because an inactivated vaccine may not be effective during this period. An inactivated vaccine administered during the period of altered immunocompetence will have to be repeated after immune function has improved.</p> <p>The nature of altered immunocompetence in an employee should be assessed by a physician. The challenge for clinicians and other healthcare providers is assessing the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for conditions associated with primary or secondary immunodeficiency, especially when new therapeutic modalities are being used and information about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines has not been characterized fully in persons receiving these drugs.</p> <p>Laboratory studies can be useful for assessing the effects of a disease or drug on the immune system. Tests useful to assess humoral immunity include immunoglobulin levels and specific antibody levels, for example, tetanus and diphtheria.</p><br><p><b>Vaccination Records</b></p><p>Appropriate and timely documentation of vaccination should always be a priority. It helps ensure that persons in need of recommended vaccine doses receive them.</p> <p>Controlling the number of excess doses administered to employees brings down the costs incurred by employees, providers, insurers, vaccination programs and other stakeholders.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, avoidance of excess doses of vaccines helps decrease the number of adverse reactions to vaccines. Health care providers who administer vaccines should ensure that the permanent medical record (or a permanent office log or file) of the recipient indicates the date the vaccine was administered, the vaccine manufacturer, the vaccine lot number, and the name, address, and the title of the person administering the vaccine.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, the provider is required to record the edition date of the VIS distributed and the date in which the materials were provided.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is also necessary for providers and staff members to systematically update employees&rsquo;&nbsp; medical records to reflect any documented episodes of adverse events after vaccination and any serologic test results related to vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><br><p><b>Storage, Handling and Excursion</b></p><p>Vaccines are important resources to protect&nbsp; and employees. But they are only effective if they are stored and handled properly. Improper handling can reduce vaccine potency. This can lead to inadequate immune responses in employees.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the factors that need to be checked during storing, handling and excursion of vaccines.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Temperature&nbsp;</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Thermostats should not be relieon to monitor temperature because they may not measure the temperature where the vaccines are stored. It is recommended that additional thermometers be placed inside the unit next to the vaccines on the storage shelf and used for monitoring purposes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Room temperature should also be monitored at every refrigerator reading. To provide the best safety margin for temperature fluctuations within the +2&deg;C/35.6&deg;F to +8&deg;C/46.4&deg;F range, the refrigerator compartment should be set at +5&deg;C/41&deg;F, which is mid-range and allows for suitable temperature fluctuations.</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Refrigerated and Frozen Vaccines</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Heat-sensitive vaccines experience an irreversible and cumulative loss of potency following&nbsp; cold chain breaches. On the other hand, cold-sensitive vaccines experience an immediate loss of potency following freezing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Vaccines should always be placed on the middle rack in the center of the refrigerator or freezer. They should never be placed on the side of the door or in vegetable crisper bins.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Adjusting the Temperature&nbsp;</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Temperature should be adjusted when it is outside the recommended range. It should also be adjusted if temperature trends over time demonstrate it to be moving toward the upper or lower temperature limit.&nbsp;</p> <p>In locations with multiple healthcare providers a vaccine coordinator and alternate vaccine coordinator should be designated.&nbsp;</p> <p>The designated vaccine coordinator&nbsp; should have sole authority of adjusting the temperature. Staff members should notify the vaccine coordinator if they notice the&nbsp; unit requires adjustment.. If the vaccine coordinator is not available, contact the alternate vaccine coordinator. If neither is available, contact your Regional Account Manager for further direction. Temperature deviations need to be corrected immediately. It is unacceptable to delay temperature deviation corrective actions.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Factors Affecting Temperature Variation&nbsp;</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Many factors alter the temperature of vaccines inside a freezer or refrigerator. Temperature stability is ensured by testing the temperature twice daily and recording the findings. CDC recommendations on vaccine refrigeration are a useful referene.</p> <p>Temperatures can vary in the storage unit based on the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>Load present in the unit</li> <li>Seasonal temperature</li> <li>How often the door is opened or left ajar&nbsp;</li> <li>Power interruptions</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Expiry&nbsp;</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Any multi-dose vial without the first puncture date on the vial should be discarded immediately. The same is true for any uncapped vials. You must discard them immediately in accordance with onsite biomedical waste guidelines.</p> <p>Inventory management ensures appropriate use and minimization of waste. Stock should be rotated to ensure vaccine with the shortest expiry date is used first.</p> <p><strong>Handling a Temperature Excursion in Your Vaccine Storage Unit</strong></p> <p>Any temperature reading outside ranges recommended by the manufacturer is a temperature excursion.&nbsp;</p> <p>You must identify temperature excursions quickly and take immediate action to correct them. This can prevent vaccine waste and the potential need to revaccinate employees.</p> <p>Here are the steps you need to follow while handling temperature excursions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Notify</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>Notify the primary or alternate vaccine coordinator immediately. You can also report the problem to your Regional Account Manager. . Label the exposed vaccines &ldquo;DO NOT USE&rdquo; to ensure that other team members avoid them. Place them in a separate container apart from other vaccines in the storage unit. Do not discard these vaccines. Only the vaccine coordinators or Regional Account Manager can authorize discarding vaccine.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Document</strong></li> </ul> <p>Document details of the temperature excursion including:</p> <ul> <li>Date and time&nbsp;</li> <li>Storage unit temperature</li> <li>Room temperature&nbsp;</li> <li>Name of the person completing the report</li> <li>General description of the event</li> <li>If using a Digital Data Logger (DDL), determine the length of time the vaccine may have been affected</li> <li>Inventory of affected vaccines&nbsp;</li> <li>List of items in the unit other than vaccines (including water bottles)&nbsp;</li> <li>Any problems with the storage unit and/or affected vaccines before the event&nbsp;</li> <li>Other relevant information</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Contact</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;Contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer(s) for guidance per your standard operating procedures (SOPs). Be prepared to provide the manufacturer or immunization program with documentation and DDL data so they can offer you the best guidance.</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Correct</strong></strong></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;If the temperature alarm goes off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until you have determined and addressed the cause.</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Check the basics, including:</strong></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Power supply</li> <li>Unit door(s)</li> <li>Thermostat settings</li> </ul> <p>If you believe the storage unit has failed, implement your emergency vaccine SOPs. Never allow vaccines to remain in a non-functioning unit.</p>"}
